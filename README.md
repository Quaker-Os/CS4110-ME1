  Alan Turing's 1950 paper, "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," is one of the most well-known and popular works in artificial intelligence. In the paper, Turing considers the question, "Can machines think?" Turing argues that since the words "think" and "machine" cannot be clearly defined, we should "replace the question with another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively easy-to-define and understood words." To do this, he must first find a simple and unambiguous idea to replace the word "think." Second, he must explain exactly which "machines" he is considering. Finally, armed with these tools, he formulates a new question, related to the original, that he believes he can answer affirmatively.

  Rather than determining if a machine is thinking, Turing suggests we should ask if the machine can win a game called the "Imitation Game." As Turing described it, the original Imitation Game is a simple party game involving three players. Player A is a man, Player B is a woman, and Player C who plays as the interrogator can be of either sex. In the Imitation Game, Player C is unable to see either Player A or Player B (and knows them only as X and Y) and can communicate with them only through written notes or any other form that does not give away any details about their gender. By asking Player A and Player B questions, Player C tries to determine which of the two is the man and which is the woman. Player A's role is to trick the interrogator into making the wrong decision, while Player B attempts to assist the interrogator in making the correct one.

  Turing's answer to his question "Can machines think?" using practical, testable questions of whether a machine can succeed in the Imitation Game that laid the foundation for what we now refer to as the Turing Test. His approach shifted the focus from a somewhat abstract philosophical discussion to an observable behavior, focusing the importance of functionality over attempting to define the elusive concept of "think." This framework has had a lasting impact on artificial intelligence research, establishing a pragmatic method for evaluating machine intelligence that continues to be relevant in contemporary discussions on AI.
